# Privacy Policy for YTgify (Firefox Extension)

**Last Updated: October 31, 2025**

## Introduction

YTgify ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Firefox extension.

## Information Collection and Use

### What We DON'T Collect

The YTgify extension does **NOT**:

- Collect personal information
- Track user behavior or analytics
- Send any data to external servers
- Store cookies or tracking identifiers
- Access your browsing history
- Monitor your YouTube viewing habits
- Share any information with third parties

### What We Store Locally

The Extension stores the following data **locally on your device only**:

1. **User Preferences**: Your settings (button visibility, frame rate, quality, etc.) are stored in Firefox's local storage (browser.storage.local)
2. **Temporary Data**: Video frames are temporarily processed in memory during GIF creation
3. **GIF Files**: Created GIFs are downloaded directly to your downloads folder via Firefox's downloads API

All data remains on your device and is never transmitted elsewhere.

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only

- User preferences are stored locally using Firefox's browser.storage.local API
- GIFs are downloaded directly to your computer's downloads folder
- No cloud storage or external servers are used
- No persistent GIF library in browser storage (GIFs go straight to downloads)

### Data Deletion

You can delete all stored preferences at any time by:

1. Removing the Extension from Firefox
2. Clearing the Extension's data through Firefox settings (about:preferences#privacy)
3. Downloaded GIFs are regular files in your downloads folder and can be deleted like any file

## Permissions Used

The Extension requires certain permissions to function:

- **storage**: To save your preferences locally (button visibility, settings)
- **activeTab**: To interact with the YouTube video on the current tab
- **tabs**: To detect navigation and manage extension state
- **downloads**: To save GIFs to your computer's downloads folder
- **Host permission (youtube.com)**: To access YouTube video content for GIF creation

These permissions are used solely for the Extension's core functionality and not for data collection.

## YouTube Content

The Extension:

- Only accesses YouTube videos you explicitly choose to create GIFs from
- Does not store YouTube URLs or video metadata beyond what's needed for GIF creation
- Respects YouTube's Terms of Service
- Does not bypass any YouTube restrictions or DRM

## Third-Party Services

The Extension does **NOT** use any third-party services, including:

- Analytics services
- Advertising networks
- Social media integrations
- Cloud storage providers
- External APIs

## Children's Privacy

The Extension does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. The Extension is designed for general audiences and does not target children.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- Data security depends on your device's security
- We recommend keeping your device and Firefox browser updated
- Use device-level security features (passwords, encryption) for additional protection

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above. Continued use of the Extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:

- **Access**: All preferences are stored locally and accessible through the Extension
- **Deletion**: Remove data at any time through Extension settings or by uninstalling
- **Portability**: Your GIFs are regular files in your downloads folder
- **No Collection**: Since we don't collect data, there's nothing to request or opt-out from

## Open Source
